//---------------------------The User's Name--------------------------
//This .dic file has to do with setting the user's name and suffix/prefix (optional). You may recall some of the functions mentioned here from bootend.dic. As you can see, you can spread functions across multiple .dic files if you like! Just remember my note in bootend.dic about the different between OnFunction and Function.

//This file is fairly short, so don't worry! It shouldn't take you too long to finish.

//Make sure to read the walkthrough (http://www.ashido.com/ukagaka/walkthrough.html) for more details about how to properly format ghost dialogue!
//I will reiterate that you should be editing these in Notepad++, and in particular, you should set the Language to C (or Java I guess) to properly highlight all the text. It will make things A LOT EASIER for you, trust me! It will also help you keep track of your brackets in case you forget some. If you click on a line with a bracket in Notepad++, it should highlight where the other bracket ends, or turn purple if there's no finishing bracket (which you should definitely fix!)
//It will also highlight my commented lines in green, so you'll know where they are. Any line beginning with // is a commented line that the code will not read. It's just for your reference!

//If you see a big block of commented text you want to uncomment, highlight the text and then hit ctrl-shift-k in Notepad++ and that should uncomment it. Mostly this is intended for advanced users.


//--OnTeachName
//This is called from the config menu in the main character's double click menu when the user says they want to change their name. If you look in menu.dic you'll see the code leading to here.

OnTeachName	
{
	if reference0 == "TEACHNAME" //ignore this
		{
		"\0\s[0]Oh, you want to change your name?\w8\n\What do you want it to be?\![open,inputbox,OnNameTeach,-1]\e"
		//This is the bit of dialogue you can rewrite if you want. Note that this line ends with \![open,inputbox,OnNameTeach,-1]. You may recognize this from bootend.dic. Essentially, this will lead to the next function. Make sure you don't delete that tag! The rest you can do whatever with though.
		}
	else
		{
		//This else statement is empty, and I'm mostly pointing this out to mention that you can do this too with your if/elses if you want! An empty else will simply cause your ghost not to do anything. I wouldn't get too crazy with this though.
		}
}


//--OnNameTeach
//This is where the user inputs their name and the ghost analyzes it. If you want your ghost to have specific responses to certain names, this is where you would add them. If not, you can blank OnNameTeach and just leave these three lines in there.

//OnNameTeach
// {
	//tempname = reference0
	//username = tempname
	//"\0\s[0]The user is now called %(username).\e"
// }

//For this template, we're going to check at least for the user having the same name as Girl or Triangle and if the user puts in a valid name.

	//Those extra TOLOWER/REPLACE things up there basically clean up the user's input so you don't have to check for Girl, GIRL, girl, GiRl, etc. It'll make it much easier to check for any specific name, since you won't have to account for any edge cases. Note that the names you will be checking for should be in all lowercase, however.

//The rest of this is for advanced users who want to add titles to their user's names. If you're not interested, you can ignore this and move on to another file.


//*********************Advanced User Info*******************************
	//If you want to let your user add a title to their name, like Lady or Master, then you'll want to expand this section a little. This check would go AFTER the check above for a valid name, leading to further choices instead of setting the name. So you'd want to uncomment and put in the else above...
	
	// {
		// "\0\s[0]Do you want a title?\w4\n\n[half]\![*]\q[Nope,titlenone]\n"
		// //You can replace "\0\s[0]Do you want a title?", but don't touch the rest of it.
		// --
		// if presuffix == "masculine" //this value was defined in bootend.dic and menu.dic when the user chose their pronouns. Thus, if someone chose he/him pronouns, they would be able to choose Mr. or Master. If the user hasn't set their pronouns, or that's not a feature of your ghost, you can just put all the choices together without these presuffix checks and let the user decide from all.
		// {
		// "\![*]\q[Mr.,titlemr]\n/
		// \![*]\q[Master,titlemaster]\n"
		// }
		// elseif presuffix == "feminine" //Likewise, if someone chose she/her pronouns, they could choose Ms. or Lady.
		// {
		// "\![*]\q[Ms.,titlems]\n/
		// \![*]\q[Lady,titlelady]\n"
		// }
		// -- //the titles after this are gender neutral and will appear for all users. If you want to remove the masculine and feminine titles entirely, just delete from the curly bracket one line up to the double dashes above "if presuffix == "masculine". That should leave only the neutral titles. Make sure to leave a set of double dashes above the neutral titles though. You can also just put the feminine and masculine titles in here too if you want all titles to be available to all users at all times.
		// "\![*]\q[-ssi,titlessi]\n/
		// \![*]\q[-san,titlesan]\e"
		// //Note that the final line here ends with \e instead of \n/, since it is the final option. Make sure your final option (and ONLY your final option) always ends with \e. More on that in the box below.
	// }
	//Adding new titles for your users to use is simply a matter of copy and pasting creatively. You can see how the ghost puts together the title and your name in the Select. sections below. Above, you simply need to add a new option and link it to a new Select. For example, you could add "\![*]\q[Mistress,titlemistress]\n/" between Ms. and Lady up there, then write up a Select.titlemistress below that fits the pattern of the others.
	//***********************************************************************
	
	//The following Select.title[word] functions add the title to the user's name, then go to the final step, NameDone. You don't have to touch any of these. Advanced users, notice how these match the linked functions in the choices above.
