Hello!!!
This is the readme file for the 'Mimomu' ghost!
You can call me Blue or Bulle or whatever fancies you. UwU 
You can find me on tumblr under the name Bluepallilword!
This ghost is based on two of my ocs/shipkids, Mimosa and Mu! 
If you don't know them (how did you end up here???), I hope you'll enjoy discovering them! 
Both are children and had a rough life but they have a large (and supportive) social circle, they will talk to you about them. 
Mimosa will at least, Mu is mute!

---------------How does the ghost work?-----------------------------------------

Right-click Mimosa to bring up the SSP right-click menu. 
Double-click Mimosa to bring up his own personal menu.
Double-click Mu to bring up her menu.
You can pet Mimosa by stroking his head or face, and hit him by double-clicking his face. Likewise, you can pet Mu by touching her face or tentacle, and hit her by double clicking her face.

Click on underlined highlighted words to have more explanations on a name! Underlined sentences starting by "more on..." are links to the character's ref on my blog.

You can force them to speak by hitting the "t" key.
You can also force them to repeat what they just said by hitting the "r" key.

-------------More on menus and features-----------------------------------------

Adjust their talk rate in the config menu (findable in Mimosa's personal menu), same if you want to change your name, pronoums, birthday... (One special dialogue on your birthday! Nothing fancy but still.)
If you hit the "functions" button, you can make them empty your bin or open a calendar!

You can give them gifts, ask them stories and drawings, make them watch stuff with you and even play simple games with them!

-------------Silly suggestions---------------------------------------------------

Mu is an amazing sitter, I tested it trust me, don't hesitate to move her across your screen to make her sit on random stuff >w<

As you might notice if you search through the files, this ghost was based on the "Girl and Triangle Ghost Template" by Zarla (http://www.ashido.com /zarla.livejournal.com / zarla.dreamwidth.org /zarla-s.tumblr)

-------------Problem?------------------------------------------------------------

I honestly don't know if I'd able to fix it if you have a problem (I am bad at code!!!) but tell me if you encounter one, just in case!
